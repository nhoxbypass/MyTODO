## Notes

(Describe any challenges encountered while building the app).

It's hard to implement any design pattern model like MVP or MVVP because i'm not quite understand it, so my code seem to be a mess.
Time is not enough because i'm still have many deadlines and projects in my school

Anyway, Thanks CoderSchool very much for this useful course!
